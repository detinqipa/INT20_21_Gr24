</div>
<p><b>As with anything in life, animal movies are not all created equal. Some are much more beloved than others. Here are the 10 best of all time. </b></p>

    <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">March of the penguins</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/marchofthepenguins.jpg" width="600" height="396" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Sometimes the best story is the real one. It was the case with March of the Penguins, the 2005 documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman. The film follows the life of a group of emperor penguins beginning at the end of summer in Antarctica.

            The penguins travel to their breeding grounds and viewers are treated to scenes of their natural mating ritual and the journey that follows, from egg to hatchling. The father penguins are left to look after the eggs as the mothers make their way to the sea to get food and bring it back to their babies.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Rise of the planet of the apes</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes.jpg" width="640" height="360" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the 2011 sci-fi prequel to the 1968 original. It looks at how apes became the dominant species on the planet, beginning with Caesar, an infant chimp exposed to an experimental drug to fight Alzheimer's before he was born.

            The drug leads Caesar to display human-level intelligence. Scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) continues to experiment on Caesar as he grows. Caesar is portrayed by the godfather of motion capture technology, Andy Serkis. Not all scientists are as kind to Caesar as Will Rodman.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">The birds</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/thebirds.jpg" width="640" height="388" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Not all of the best movies star animals that the audience loves or would want to get to know in real life, as is the case with Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror masterpiece, The Birds. The horror of the film comes from how possible it all seems.

            Birds are everywhere in our everyday lives and the idea that one day they might turn evil, or vengeful, and turn against humans is horrifying. There is little that could be done to prevent their attacks, especially if they came in flocks.

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Paddington 2 </li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/paddington.jpg" width="660" height="400" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Like The Empire Strikes Back, sometimes the sequel surpasses even the original in how much an audience loves it. That is the case with Paddington 2, the family-friendly tale of Paddington bear and his life with the Brown family.The sequel sees Paddington as both an accepted member of the family and the town in which he lives. When the book he wishes to buy for his aunt's birthday is stolen, Paddington will go to great and heartwarming lengths to retrieve the gift before the day of the celebration arrives.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Life of PI</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/6-Life-of-Pi.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Life of Pi was based on Yann Martel's award-winning novel of the same name. The film was helmed by award-winning director, Ang Lee, and released in 2012. The story follows a teenager, Pi, after the boat transporting his family and the animals in their zoo from India to Canada sinks.

            Pi is the only human survivor, though he is joined in his lifeboat by a Bengal tiger, orangutan, zebra, and hyena. Eventually, the Tiger consumes most of the others, and Pi and the tiger must learn to survive together until they are able to make landfall or find rescue.</p>

        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background"> Zootopia</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Zootopia.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Zootopia is a 2016 award-winning Disney animated film. The film is all about animals, as it explores the lives of the anthropomorphized animals in the city of Zootopia. It focuses on police rabbit, Judy Hopps, and her teaming up with Nick Wilde, a scheming fox, to prove that she can make it as a cop in the big city.

            The film starred the voice talent of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. </p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Jaws </li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Jaws.jpg.png" width="640" height="482" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Jaws is a very different movie from Zootopia, but both sit toward the top of the list with 8 stars. While Zootopia was successful because of all the animals that could be seen, Jaws was successful, in part, because its titular animal goes unseen for so long.

            It's the score of the film, done by John Williams, that carries most of the weight of presenting the giant shark until the end of the Steven Spielberg blockbuster. Why did it take so long to show the shark on screen? Because the animatronic on set wasn't working. What a different movie it would have been if things had gone according to plan.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">HACHI : A dog's tale</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/hachi-a-dogs-tale.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Animal films can educate, enlighten, entertain, frighten, or just make an audience cry their eyes out. Hachi was just such a crying movie. The 2009 film stars Richard Gere and tells the story of Parker Wilson, a professor, who finds an abandoned Akita and takes it home with him.The Akita, Hachi is incredibly loyal, even waiting at the train station every day for Parker's return. But one day Parker doesn't return, and yet Hachi's loyalty is unwavering. Cue the waterworks.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Finding Nemo</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Finding-Nemo-1.jpg" width="640" height="347" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>The animated fish in Pixar's Finding Nemo swam their way into the hearts of audiences and never let go.

            From Marlin's desperate search for his son to Dory's unwavering loyalty, and all the fishy friendships in between, the tale was both heartwarming, hysterical, and impeccably well animated.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">The Lion King</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Disney-Lion-King.jpg" width="640" height="267" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Even with all of Pixar's animation and success they still can't quite top the classic Disney hand-drawn animation of the family favorite, The Lion King. the story of Simba and Mufasa, the circle of life, and the safety of the Pride Lands, was such a Disney hit it was even received its own live-action remake only last year in 2019. </p>

          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/falconry.jpeg" width="600" height="396" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>For a truly unforgettable experience, you can visit Sky Falconry in San Diego, Calif. Their mission is to educate the public and offer hands-on experiences (no pun intended), with free-flying birds of prey. You can choose from a number of different classes and experiences to interact with these majestic birds. A basic falconry lesson will teach you how to hold a hawk, cast it from your glove and call it back again. Their "hawk walks" allow you to interact with trained raptors while hiking trails in the San Diego mountains</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Kangaroo Sanctuary (Australia)</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/kangaroo.jpeg" width="640" height="360" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>If you're traveling to Australia, stop at the Kangaroo Sanctuary in Alice Springs. The 188-acre preserve is home to orphaned baby kangaroos as well as adults who have been rescued.

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background"> Farm Sanctuary </li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/sanctuary.jpeg" width="640" height="388" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Travel to upstate New York to visit the Farm Sanctuary, home to more than 800 rescued farm animals including cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chickens. Most of the animals have been rescued from factory farms, but at the sanctuary, they can roam free. You can rent a cabin or tiny home for overnight visits to get an inside look at what farm life is like. And if you happen to be on the West Coast, there is an additional Farm Sanctuary location in Los Angeles. This spot would make a fun family trip for the entire family.

          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/hawaii.jpeg" width="660" height="400" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>

The Kauai Humane Society has an amazing program that allows you to adopt a shelter dog just for the day when you're visiting the area: Shelter Dogs on Field Trips. After getting matched up with your companion, the dog gets a swanky "Adopt Me" vest, then the two of you get to the hit the road for the day. You can visit the beach, go on a hike or relax in the park. It's a great way to give a shelter dog a special adventure and get your dog fix at the same time. Win-win.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Best Friends Animal Society (Utah)</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Utah.jpeg" width="640" height="347" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Best Friends Animal Society has locations in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta, but their sanctuary in Utah is an incredibly special place. It's the largest no-kill sanctuary in the nation for homeless animals, and their goal is to help create a similar no-kill system in shelters all over the country. On any given day, the sanctuary is home to more than 1,600 animals, many of whom have special needs. Plan a volunteer trip to Best Friends to help care for the animals, work with the staff and ready animals for adoption. While you're there you can also visit some of the beautiful spots around the sanctuary like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon and Lake Powell.</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Wild Animal Sanctuary (Colorado)</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Colorado.jpeg" width="640" height="267" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Wild Animal Sanctuary is the largest carnivore sanctuary in the world and is home to more than 400 rescued lions, tigers, bears and wolves. With 720 acres in Keenesburg, Colo., animals have plenty of space to roam free. If not for the sanctuary, most of these creatures would have been euthanized. Seeing the animals is a unique experience, too, since the sanctuary has built one of the largest elevated walkways in existence. This means you're able to see the animals above their natural environment, unlike animals at a traditional zoo.</p>

    <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Sky Falconry (California)</li></h2><br />
    <p>For a truly unforgettable experience, you can visit Sky Falconry in San Diego, Calif. Their mission is to educate the public and offer hands-on experiences (no pun intended), with free-flying birds of prey. You can choose from a number of different classes and experiences to interact with these majestic birds. A basic falconry lesson will teach you how to hold a hawk, cast it from your glove and call it back again. Their "hawk walks" allow you to interact with trained raptors while hiking trails in the San Diego mountains</p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Kangaroo Sanctuary (Australia)</li></h2><br />
          
          <p>If you're traveling to Australia, stop at the Kangaroo Sanctuary in Alice Springs. The 188-acre preserve is home to orphaned baby kangaroos as well as adults who have been rescued. It was even featured in a National Geographic documentary, Kangaroo Dundee. Since kangaroos sleep during the day, they offer sunset tours that allow you to see the 'roos just as they're waking up </p>

          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background"> Farm Sanctuary </li></h2><br />
          <p>Travel to upstate New York to visit the Farm Sanctuary, home to more than 800 rescued farm animals including cows, pigs, goats, sheep and chickens. Most of the animals have been rescued from factory farms, but at the sanctuary, they can roam free. You can rent a cabin or tiny home for overnight visits to get an inside look at what farm life is like. And if you happen to be on the West Coast, there is an additional Farm Sanctuary location in Los Angeles. This spot would make a fun family trip for the entire family.</p>

          <p>Best Friends Animal Society has locations in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta, but their sanctuary in Utah is an incredibly special place. It's the largest no-kill sanctuary in the nation for homeless animals, and their goal is to help create a similar no-kill system in shelters all over the country. On any given day, the sanctuary is home to more than 1,600 animals, many of whom have special needs. Plan a volunteer trip to Best Friends to help care for the animals, work with the staff and ready animals for adoption. While you're there you can also visit some of the beautiful spots around the sanctuary like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon and Lake Powell.</p>

With 720 acres in Keenesburg, Colo., animals have plenty of space to roam free. If not for the sanctuary, most of these creatures would have been euthanized. Seeing the animals is a unique experience, too, since the sanctuary has built one of the largest elevated walkways in existence. This means you're able to see the animals above their natural environment, unlike animals at a traditional zoo.</p>

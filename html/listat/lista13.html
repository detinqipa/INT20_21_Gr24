  <h1 class="folder-lista">Top 10 Reasons Why We Love Dogs</h1>
</div>
<p><b>Dog owners are, shall we say, a special breed.  We share that special love of dogs and know how important they are to our lives.  But why, exactly do we love dogs so much? 
     There are a lot of answers to this question (and unique ones for each dog!), but here are the top ten.</b></p>
  <ol reversed>
        <div>
    <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Loyalty</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Loyal.jpg" width="600" height="396" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>There are some that would say a dog is only loyal so long as it is getting food and shelter. But if you have ever known a dog and seen the reaction it has when you come home or it is reunited with a fellow four legged friend you know it is about more than that. 
              There are plenty of examples of dogs showing loyalty to their owners.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Friendship</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Friendship.jpg" width="640" height="360" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Dogs have been human’s best friends for thousands of years. They are there for us through thick and thin. They never judge and are always happy to see us return, whether we’ve been gone five hours or five minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Therapy</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/therapy.jpg" width="640" height="388" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p> Animal-assisted therapy has been linked to the reduction of anxiety, pain, and depression in people with a range of mental or physical health problems. Many people can benefit from pet therapy, including patients undergoing chemotherapy, 
              veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical therapy patients working on their fine motor skills. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Health</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/health.jpg" width="660" height="400" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>There are many ways that having a dog is good for our health. People with dogs are shown to have less heart problems because they get regular exercise from walking their pets. Having a dog improves our mood and reduces stress which in turn means lower blood pressure.
               Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress and increasing happiness.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Unconditional Love</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/love.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>It’s easy to see with the wagging and happy barking when we come home that our dogs love us. Scientists have recently proven that dogs love us back the same way we love them by scanning their brains in an MRI machine. 
              Those body wiggles aren’t just because he is excited for food (but it’s probably safe to say that’s a part of it).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Protection</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/protection.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>It is believed that man’s first interactions with dogs (wolves at the time) resulted in a beneficial relationship for both species. The wolves got easy pickings from the scraps that people left behind after their meals and people got the benefit of having the wolves around to protect them from any other predators that may prey on those people. 
              In more recent times, dogs were trained by the military as sentry guards, protecting troops from attack. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Selflessness </li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/selflessness.jpg" width="640" height="482" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Your dog never lies to you when he says he loves you. The more you give of yourself, the better the connection developed between the two of you. There is nothing better 
              than coming home from a very hard day at work or maybe school or college and find your dog there waiting for you to support you.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Exercise</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/exercise.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>Dogs requires daily exercise, and we do to. Dog owners carry the responsibility of playing with and working their dogs, so it only makes sense that dog people tend to be more active. One study found
               that dog owners were 34 percent more likely to achieve their recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week than non-dog owners.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Forgiveness</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/forgivness.jpg" style="margin-left: 300px" /></div>
          <p>Dogs don’t hold grudges. They don’t hang on to what someone said years ago. When one of them plays too rough, 
              the other dog lets them know immediately by letting out a yelp. The two dogs make up and instantly start playing again.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2><li class="folder-lista-background">Happiness</li></h2><br />
          <div class="folder-lista-background"><img src="../../images/Happiness.jpg" width="640" height="267" class="folder-lista-photo" /></div>
          <p>The great pleasure of a dog is that you may make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you, but he will make a fool of himself too.</p>
